## Troubleshooting:

### If email doesn't arrive:
- Check spam/junk folder
- Wait 1-2 minutes (sometimes delayed)
- Verify access key is correct in contact.js

### If Discord doesn't work:
- Check if webhook URL is still valid
- Look at browser console (F12) for errors
- Webhook might have been deleted from Discord

### If form shows error:
- Open browser console (F12) to see error details
- Check internet connection
- Try again in a few seconds

## Next Steps:

1. **Test the form** with real data
2. **Check both email and Discord** for submissions
